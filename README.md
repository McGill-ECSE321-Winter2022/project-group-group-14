Hi! I'm a third year mechanical engineering student minoring in software engineering. Software started out as a hobby for me, but as I began taking more classes in my major that related to programming, I was gradually inspired to make it part of my degree as well.  When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy recreational activities like running marathons and playing music. More about me here: https://samuelvalentine.netlify.app
