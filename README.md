# Welcome to team 14's grocery store system's wiki!
The goal of this project is to create a software system that could be used by customers, employees and managers alike to service a grocery store. 
For the workers, the system provides scheduling and inventory features. For customers, the system offers ordering for delivery or pickup. 
This software will be made available via website, desktop application, and android application, in order to maximize ease of accessibility.

# Our Team

### Clarissa Baciu
Hi, I am a second year computer engineering student. I've had industry experience working with python and have also worked with java throughout my courses. I am a fast learner and can effectively work as part of a team. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing a variety of sports and making terrible jokes.

An SQL statement walks into a bar and sees two tables. It approaches, and asks “may I join you?”. 

### Harry Park
Hi, I'm a third-year student in Computer Engineering. I always looked up to IT developers growing up and ended up starting coding in C as a hobby in middle school. I was always interested in music and art, but I ended up choosing Computer Engineering as my major, so currently I'm aspiring to be a software developer in music industry and maybe develop a mixing application one day.

### Youssof Mohammed
Hello, I'm a second-year student in Software Engineering. I have been introduced to coding 5 years ago and I loved it. I started coding in c++ and understood the basics of coding and then started the journey of learning a bunch of other new programming languages in different programming fields. During this journey I learned game development, web development, and competitive programming skills. I became obsessed with coding so I decided to apply for the software engineering field to follow my dream.

### Yakir Bender
Hallo, I'm a third-year student in Computer Engineering. I have coded and tutored in Java for several years, but have experience working in C. Originally, I had considered working in other fields, like accounting or finances. But, I was a little too interested in puzzles and problem-solving, so engineering was a perfect fit. I enjoy playing video games in my free time, especially Role-Playing Games and Fighting Games. The games definitely did not influence my decision in choosing computer engineering. Not at all.

### Samuel Valentine
Hi! I'm a third year mechanical engineering student minoring in software engineering. Software started out as a hobby for me, but as I began taking more classes in my major that related to programming, I was gradually inspired to make it part of my degree as well.  When I'm not studying or working, I enjoy recreational activities like running marathons and playing music. More about me here: https://samuelvalentine.netlify.app
